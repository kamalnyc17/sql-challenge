### In this project we will analyze the employee data between 1980s and 1990s and produce following reports:-

#### List following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
#### List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
#### List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
#### List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
#### List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
#### List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
#### List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
#### In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

### After analyzing the above information, we will import the SQL database into Pandas to perform following visualizations:-

#### Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.
#### Create a bar chart of average salary by job title.
